cryptsetup (utility for setting up encrypted filesystems)

LUKS is a standard for cross-platform hard disk encryption.
It provides secure management of multiple userpasswords and
stores setup information in the partition header.
LUKS for dm-crypt is now implemented in cryptsetup replacing the
original cryptsetup. It provides all the functionally of the
original version plus all LUKS features.
